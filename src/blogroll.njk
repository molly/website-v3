<h1>Blogroll</h1>
<p>
  This is an incomplete list of some of the blogs I like to read. It changes
  often.<br />
  If you want to add them all to your RSS reader,
  <a href="/blogroll.opml.xml">download the OPML</a> file. However, please note that this is a bit of a firehose â€” 
  you might prefer to pick and choose from the list!

<ul class="blog-list">

<h2>News</h2>
<ul class="blog-list">
  {% for blog in newsBlogroll %}
