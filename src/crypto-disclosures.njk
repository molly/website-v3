<h2>Disclosures</h2>
<small>Last updated March 4, 2023.</small>
<p>I strongly believe in clear disclosures by journalists and others writing about cryptocurrencies and related topics.
  All outlets publishing cryptocurrency-related articles should have very clear and prominently-displayed disclosure
  policies.</p>
<p>I own small amounts (less than $500 worth at time of purchase) of crypto tokens or other crypto assets, which belong
  to an undisclosed address I use for research purposes. These do not represent a significant portion of my assets, and
  are used primarily to access token-gated projects and experiment with smart contracts rather than for any attempt to
  earn a return. If I do somehow end up with more money than I put in as a result, I intend to donate it.</p>
<p>From November 2022 to October 2023, I was a Fellow at Harvard's <a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu/"
    target="_blank">Library
    Innovation Lab</a>, which supported me in my work for a year. This fellowship was enabled by the
  <a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu/about/democratizing-open-knowledge" target="_blank">Democratizing Open
    Knowledge</a>
  program, which is funded by the <a href="https://ffdweb.org/" target="_blank">Filecoin Foundation for the
    Decentralized Web</a>, a "nonprofit organization committed to preserving humanity's most important information by
  fostering the development of open-source software and open protocols". As the name suggests, they are organized around
  the <a href="https://fil.org/about/">Filecoin</a> project, which is a cryptocurrency/blockchain project. The
  fellowship had no strings attached as far as my independence in researching and analyzing the crypto industry, and I
  was not obligated to do any work relating to Filecoin (nor was I obligated <i>not</i> to). My focus at the LIL
  did not involve Filecoin specifically.
</p>
<p>I have a <a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/" target="_blank">Substack</a>, where some enormously generous
  people support my work. This includes the writing and research I do pertaining to crypto, as well as all of my other
  various and sundry interests. There is more detail on this in <a href="https://newsletter.mollywhite.net/p/issue-0"
    target="_blank">Issue 0</a> of my newsletter.</p>
<p>I don't post sponsored content on my <i>
    <a href="http://web3isgoinggreat.com/" target="_blank">Web3 Is Going
      Great</a>
  </i>
  project, its associated Twitter account, this website, my blog, my personal Twitter account, or anywhere else. This
  will not change. No, I won't promote your project regardless of whether there is money changing hands, so please don't
  ask.</p>
<p>A few generous people have sent money for <i>W3IGG</i>'s cloud hosting and various other upkeep costs, which I
  otherwise pay out of pocket. There is more information on this, along with a brief expenses report, at the <a
    href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/contribute" target="_blank">
    <i>W3IGG</i> – Contribute</a> page. I don't run ads
  or otherwise directly monetize the site or my blog.</p>
<p>With respect to investments: I hold no long or short positions pertaining to cryptocurrencies or crypto-related
  companies. I do have some investments in the stock market and other traditional forms of finance, which I pay someone
  much smarter about and more interested in finance than I am to handle.</p>
<hr />
<p>While we're here, I'll mention that I don't speak on behalf of an employer or anyone else. I hope it goes without
  saying, but just to say it: nothing I say should be taken to be financial, investment, legal, professional, or any
  other kind of advice.</p>
