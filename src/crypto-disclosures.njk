<h2>Disclosures</h2>
<small>Last updated June 19, 2025.</small>
<p>
  I strongly believe in clear disclosures by journalists and others writing
  about cryptocurrencies and related topics. All outlets publishing
  cryptocurrency-related articles should have very clear and
  prominently-displayed disclosure policies.
</p>
<p>
  I own small amounts (less than $500 worth at time of purchase) of crypto
  tokens or other crypto assets, which belong to an undisclosed address I use
  for research purposes. These do not represent a significant portion of my
  assets, and are used primarily to access token-gated projects and experiment
  with smart contracts rather than for any attempt to earn a return. If I do
  somehow end up with more money than I put in as a result, I intend to donate
  it.<sup><a href="#footnote1">1</a></sup>

  From November 2022 to October 2023, I was a Fellow at Harvard's
  <a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu/" target="_blank"
    >Library Innovation Lab</a
  >, which supported me in my work for a year. This fellowship was enabled by
  the
  <a
    href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu/about/democratizing-open-knowledge"
    target="_blank"
    >Democratizing Open Knowledge</a
  >
  program, which is funded by the
  <a href="https://ffdweb.org/" target="_blank"
    >Filecoin Foundation for the Decentralized Web</a
  >, a "nonprofit organization committed to preserving humanity's most important
  information by fostering the development of open-source software and open
  protocols". As the name suggests, they are organized around the
  <a href="https://fil.org/about/">Filecoin</a> project, which is a
  cryptocurrency/blockchain project. The fellowship had no strings attached as
  far as my independence in researching and analyzing the crypto industry, and I
  was not obligated to do any work relating to Filecoin (nor was I obligated
  <i>not</i> to). My focus at the LIL did not involve Filecoin specifically.
</p>
<p>
  I have a <a href="http://citationneeded.news/" target="_blank">newsletter</a>,
  where some enormously generous people support my work financially. This
  includes the writing and research I do pertaining to crypto, the tech
  industry, as well as all of my other various and sundry interests that I write
  about.
</p>

<p>
  I don't post sponsored content on my
  <i>
    <a href="http://web3isgoinggreat.com/" target="_blank"
      >Web3 Is Going Great</a
    >
  </i>
  project, its associated Twitter account, this website, my blog, my personal
  Twitter account, or anywhere else. This will not change. No, I won't promote
  your project regardless of whether there is money changing hands, so please
  don't ask.
</p>
<p>
  A few generous people have sent money for <i>W3IGG</i>'s cloud hosting and
  various other upkeep costs, which I otherwise pay out of pocket. There is more
  information on this, along with a brief expenses report, at the
  <a href="https://web3isgoinggreat.com/contribute" target="_blank">
    <i>W3IGG</i> – Contribute</a
  >
  page. I don't run ads or otherwise directly monetize the site or my blog.
</p>
<p>
  With respect to investments: I hold no long or short positions pertaining to
  cryptocurrencies or crypto-related companies. I do have some investments in
  the stock market and other traditional forms of finance, which I pay someone
  much smarter about and more interested in finance than I am to handle.
</p>
<hr />
<p>
  While we're here, I'll mention that I don't speak on behalf of an employer or
  anyone else. I hope it goes without saying, but just to say it: nothing I say
  should be taken to be financial, investment, legal, professional, or any other
  kind of advice.

  This has happened once. In 2024, I discovered 1.4&nbsp;SOL in an old research
  wallet had appreciated by $220, so I
  <a href="/micro/entry/202403301700">donated it to the EFF</a>.
